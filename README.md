# Calculator_projects
personal projects

This code defines a graphical user interface for a calculator using the PyQt5 library. 
The interface is designed using a grid layout to arrange the buttons and other widgets in a grid. 
The code also defines styles for the buttons and other widgets using CSS-like style sheets.
To use this code, you would need to create a PyQt5 application and pass an instance of the QMainWindow class to the setupUi method defined in the code. 
This would create the user interface and attach it to the main window of the application.
You would then need to implement event handlers for the buttons and other widgets in the interface to provide the desired functionality for the calculator.
